4.3 PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS
Performance requirements describe how well a software system performs in different scenarios.Reaction time, execution time, storage capacity, and throughput come under performance of the software. Performance requirements of service levels mostly focused on aiding end-user tasks.Performance requirements, like other quality attributes, are crucial in the development and test ing of software. Although gathering requirements is an important part of the software development process, it may be a challenging undertaking. The three key challenges in gathering performance criteria are scope, skill, and stability. The scope of a project is frequently unknown in the software development business, or multiple stakeholders provide conflicting or deceptive scope evaluations. The scope of a project is frequently unknown in the software development business, or multiple stake holders provide conflicting or deceptive scope evaluations. If one stake holder discusses local needs while another addresses regional or national coverage, the system's design and performance may be quite different.Requirements are only useful if all stake holders have a thorough understanding of the project's goals,capabilities, and restrictions.
