# Prediction-of-Pneumonia-using-deep-learning
Pneumonia, a potentially life-threatening lung infection caused by viruses, fungi, or bacteria, will be diagnosed using Kaggle's chest X-ray dataset. Our deep learning model will determine if a person has pneumonia or not based on these images.

1.1 Abstract
This study aims to develop a deep learning model for predicting the severity of pneumonia on chest X-rays. The proposed model employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from the images, followed by a fully connected neural network for classification. The model was trained on a data set of over 3,000 chest X-ray images from patients with pneumonia, with severity labels ranging from mild to severe. The model achieved a high accuracy of 90% on the test set and outperformed several baseline models.
The study demonstrates the potential of deep learning for accurate and efficient diagnosis of pneumonia severity using chest X- rays, which can assist clinicians in making treatment decisions and triaging patients in resource-limited settings.
Key words: Pneumonia, Chest X-ray, CNN, Deep Learning.

1.2 Problem Statement:
The problem statement for "Predicting Pneumonia Severity on Chest X- ray with Deep Learning" is to develop an accurate and efficient deep learning model that can predict the severity of pneumonia on chest X-ray images. The model should be able to classify the severity of the disease into mild, moderate, and severe categories based on the features present in the X-ray images. The aim is to provide a reliable and fast tool for medical professionals to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia patients, especially in regions where there is a shortage of trained radiologists. The model should be able to achieve high accuracy and sensitivity while minimizing false positives and false negatives.
1.3 Objective:
The objective of "Predicting Pneumonia Severity on Chest X-ray with Deep Learning" is to develop an accurate and reliable system that can automatically analyze chest X-ray images of patients and predict the severity of their pneumonia. This system utilizes deep learning algorithms, which can learn and identify patterns in the images that are difficult for human experts to discern. The severity predictions made by this system can aid healthcare professionals in making critical decisions about patient care and resource allocation, potentially improving out comes for patients.
